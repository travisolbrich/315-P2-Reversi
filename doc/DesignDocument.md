## Purpose of Project

The goal is to create a Reversi game. This game will focus on an audience interested in strategy board games. Throughout the project, experience will then be gained in both AI algorithms as well as Server-Client programming. Finally, designing a high-quality GUI for the game will be the final step in the game's progression. The game will follow traditional Reversi rules found on the [Reversi wiki page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) as referenced by the [Project Instructions](http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/choe/13fall/315/proj2.html).
